# Operations Guide — Admin Log Viewer

**Product:** LTS-2026 Loitering Detection & Tracking System  
**Feature:** Real-Time Server Log Viewer  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2026-06-29

---

## 1. Overview

The Admin Log Viewer is a real-time browser-based log panel in the Administrator Dashboard. This guide covers how to use it, how the log relay works, and how to configure logging.

---

## 2. Accessing the Log Viewer

1. Log in with an **admin** account
2. Click your profile icon → **Admin Dashboard**
3. In the left sidebar, click **🖥️ Server Logs**

---

## 3. Log Sources

| Tab | What it shows | Update method |
|---|---|---|
| **Server** | Node.js server logs (all modules) | Real-time via Socket.IO |
| **Ingest Daemon** | Python ingest-daemon (`[Ingest]` tagged lines) | Polls log file every 2 s |
| **MediaMTX** | MediaMTX proxy (`[MediaMTX]` tagged lines) | Polls log file every 2 s |

> **Note:** The Ingest Daemon tab is hidden when the server is running in `analysis` mode.

---

## 4. Changing the Server Log Level

The **Server Log Level** dropdown controls the minimum severity relayed to the browser **in real time, without restarting the server**.

| Setting | What you see |
|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | All log lines including verbose debug output |
| `INFO` | Informational messages and above (default) |
| `WARNING` | Warnings and errors only |
| `ERROR` | Errors and critical messages only |
| `NONE` | No log relay (disables the stream) |

> **This only affects the Socket.IO relay.** File logging is controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable in `server/.env` and requires a server restart to change.

Every level change is recorded in the audit log.

---

## 5. Display Filters

The **Show Levels** buttons filter what is displayed in the browser — they do **not** change the server-side emission level.

Clicking a level badge toggles its visibility. At least one level must remain visible.

---

## 6. Connection Status

The green/gray dot in the top-right of the log panel indicates Socket.IO connection status:

- **Green** — connected; real-time updates active
- **Gray** — disconnected; attempting to reconnect

On reconnect, the client requests the last 500 buffered entries via `admin:subscribe-logs`.

---

## 7. Pause / Resume

Click **⏸ Pause** to freeze the display without disconnecting. New logs accumulate server-side. Click **▶ Resume** to resume — you will not receive the logs that arrived while paused (they will appear in `GET /admin/logs/recent` on next source switch).

---

## 8. Log File Configuration

Server-side log file settings in `server/.env`:

```env
LOG_TO_FILE=true          # Enable file writing (default: true)
LOG_DIR=/var/log/lts      # Primary log directory
LOG_LEVEL=INFO            # Minimum file log level (restart required to change)
LOG_FILTER_PATTERNS=      # Comma-separated regex patterns to suppress
```

Log file path: `/var/log/lts/lts-YYYY-MM-DD.log`  
Fallback path: `server/logs/lts-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

---

## 9. Searching Logs

A search bar is displayed between the toolbar and the stats row at all times.

### How to search

1. Click inside the search bar (or just start typing after clicking on the log panel)
2. Type a keyword — the log list filters in real-time as you type
3. Matching text is highlighted in yellow in each visible row
4. The match count shown in the search bar updates as you type
5. Click **✕** inside the search bar, or clear the field, to remove the filter

### Search behaviour

| Behaviour | Detail |
|---|---|
| Case sensitivity | Case-insensitive |
| Search scope | `msg` field and timestamp string |
| Scope | Current in-browser buffer only (up to 500 lines) — does not search log files on disk |
| Download | Respects active search — exports only matched lines |
| Stats row | Shows `🔍 filtered` tag while a query is active |

> **Tip:** To find a specific camera disconnect event, type part of the camera ID or `disconnected`. To find all errors within a time window, first set Show Levels to ERROR only, then search for the time prefix (e.g., `14:30`).

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Log viewer shows no entries

1. Check connection indicator — if gray, Socket.IO is not connected
2. Check server is running: `GET /health`
3. Confirm you are logged in as admin
4. Try switching source to Ingest/MediaMTX — if those show entries, the server logs may be below the current level

### Ingest Daemon logs are empty

1. Verify ingest-daemon is running: `curl http://localhost:7070/health`
2. Confirm `LOG_TO_FILE=true` in `server/.env`
3. Check log file exists: `ls /var/log/lts/lts-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log`
4. If log file exists but no `[Ingest]` lines, ingest-daemon may not be generating output

### Log level change not persisting after server restart

Expected — the runtime level change via `PATCH /admin/logs/level` is in-memory only. To make it permanent, set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `server/.env`.

| `GET /admin/logs/recent?source=server&limit=200` | Recent server logs from in-memory buffer |
| `GET /admin/logs/recent?source=ingest&limit=200` | Recent ingest-daemon logs from log file |
| `GET /admin/logs/recent?source=mediamtx&limit=200` | Recent MediaMTX logs from log file |
| `PATCH /admin/logs/level { level: 'INFO' }` | Change runtime relay log level |

All endpoints require JWT + `admin` role.
